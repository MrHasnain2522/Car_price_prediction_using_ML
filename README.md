#  Project title:
   Car price prediction using ML

# Intro:
This project aims to predict the price of a car based on several features like brand,
model, manufacturing year, mileage, fuel type, and more. It uses machine learning 
regression models to estimate car prices, helping users make informed decisions when
buying or selling used cars.

# Objective:
Build a regression model that can accurately predict the selling price of a car based on its features using historical data.

# Machine Learning Workflow:
  1. Data Collection
  2. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Feature scaling
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  4. Model Training
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   -  XGBoost, Lasso Regression, etc.
     5 odel Evaluation
   - R² Score
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - 
# Features Used:
 - `Year` – Year the car was purchased
 - `Present_Price` – Current ex-showroom price
 - `Kms_Driven` – Distance driven
 - `Fuel_Type` – Petrol, Diesel, or CNG
 - `Seller_Type` – Dealer or Individual
 - `Transmission` – Manual or Automatic
 - `Owner` – Number of previous owners

# Tech Stack:
 - Python
 - Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
 - Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization
 - scikit-learn – ML models and preprocessing


# Future Improvements
Add more features (engine size, number of seats, etc.)
Improve model tuning with GridSearchCV
Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
Integrate with real-time car listing APIs
